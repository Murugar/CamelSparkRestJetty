<h1>Rest Service Feeder</h1>
<h2>Camel, Spark REST by Apache</h2>

This example shows how to use Spark REST to define REST endpoints in Camel routes using the Java DSL

<br/>


<p/>
There is a <i>user</i> REST service that supports the following operations
 <ul>
   <li>view/<i>id</i> - to view a user with the given id </li>
   <li>list - to view all users</li>
   <li>update - to update/create an user</li>
 </ul>

The view and list operations are HTTP GET, and update is using HTTP PUT.

From a web browser you can access the first two services using the following links

<ul>
  <li><a href="user/view/123">user/view/123</a> - to view the user with id 123</li>
  <li><a href="user/list">user/list</a> - to list all users</li>
</ul>

<br/>

Please help us make Apache Camel better - we appreciate any feedback you may
have. Enjoy!

<br/>
